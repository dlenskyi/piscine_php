<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Class Camera represents a Camera object.
The Class constructor requires the following attributes:
-'origin': The vertex positioning the camera in the world mark. Thanks to this
vertex, we can compute a vector and then a translation matrix.
-'orientation': Rotation matrix orienting the camera in the world mark.
-'width': Width in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio.
Not compatible with the ’ratio’ key.
-'height': Height in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio.
Not compatible with the ’ratio’ key.
-'ratio': Image’s ratio. Not compatible with the ’width’ and ’height’ keys.
-'fov' : The projected image’s field of view in in degree.
-’near' : The near clipping plane.
-'far' : The far clipping plane.
Only the following public method is represented by this Class:
watchVertex( Vertex $worldVertex ) : Transforms "world" coordinates
vertex into a "screen" coordinates vertex (a pixel basically).
