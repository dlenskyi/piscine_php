<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Class Matrix represents operations on 4x4 Matrix.
When Matrix created, you wont be able to change its values after.
It has 7 Class constants: IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ,
TRANSLATION and PROJECTION;
Also you needed to follow these 'rules':
The following keys are required:
’preset’: the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class
constants previously defined.
’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.
’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX, RY
or RZ.
’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.
’fov’: projection field of view in degrees mandatory
when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’near’: projection’s near clipping plane mandatory
when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’far’: projection’s far clipping plane mandatory
when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
All of them are private attributes of the Class.
The following public methods are providing for this Class:
- mult() : returns the multiplication of both matrices in the way of new Matrix;
- transformVertex() : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
And several private methods for managing the operations under the Matrix.
